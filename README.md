PFUI for V+ Private Server (v.05)

This is a modification for the popular PFUI addon for Vanilla WoW. For information on the original mod visit shagu/pfUI

As the V+ Server adds lots of new skills and alters a lot of baseline skills along with their cast times, cooldowns, duration and adds talents
to change those, by default this mod unfortunately doesn't show the right info ingame.

With this modification extension I aim to make the ingame information display correctly.

Changelog (v.05)
